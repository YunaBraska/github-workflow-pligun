## Key Features

* 🚀 Repository Access: Integrate with your private GitHub repositories for those secret projects you're working on.
* 🗺️ Local Path Resolution: Navigate effortlessly with one-click access to local paths.
* ✅ Validation Engine: Validates linked local actions and workflows, but hey, you can turn this off too.
* 🛡️ Security: We respect your privacy! The plugin doesn't use or store your personal data; it only accesses remote
  actions and workflows when necessary.

  Templates for comprehensive project management.
